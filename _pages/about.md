My name is Mads and I live in a little country known as Denmark. We are famous for LEGO, Vikings and of course Carlsberg! I currently live in a city called Herning in the central part of Denmark, with my beautiful wife.

I began my career at an early age, where I worked as a Support Rep. for companies like Telenor, Stream Global Services (Support for Dell Laptops/Desktops), and Hewlett-Packard that then split up in 2, where I continued my career Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). In all of those jobs, one thing became very clear: I had a knack for break/fix and solving complex problems.

In 2017 I accepted the job as an IT consultant for a small company in Denmark, specializing in the modern workplace, primarily using Intune and Autopilot. Of course back then, buzzwords like "modern workplace" didn't exist, so we just called it something else: Device Management! - I also dabbled quite a lot in MDT and SCCM.
I succesfully implemented Autopilot and other technologies using Microsoft Intune in small, medium and large companies.

In March 2021 I decided it was time to try something new, so I started my own company. Within my first few days of being self-employed as a freelancer, I found [APENTO](https://www.apento.com). A small network for highly specialized freelancers within the Microsoft space, all self-employed like myself, highly motivated and super driven to achieve the best results for our customers. In APENTO, I have continued to work within the modern workplace space, where I am still working today. I spent most of my time helping a large company in Denmark adopting Intune and Autopilot, whilst I also have smaller customers on the side that I'm assisting occasionally.

I otherwise see myself as a cloud native enthusiast and advocate. I helped my first customer go cloud native back in 2019, and have since then assisted a lot of small but also large enterprises go cloud native.
