My name is Mads and I live in a little country known as Denmark. We are famous for LEGO, Vikings and of course Carlsberg! I currently live in a city called Aalborg in the northern parts of Denmark.

I began my career at an early age, where I subsequently worked as a Support Rep. for companies like Telenor, Stream Global Services (Support for Dell Laptops/Desktops), and Hewlett-Packard that then split up in 2, where I continued in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. In all of those jobs, one thing became very clear: I had a knack for break/fix and solving complex problems. 

In 2017 I accepted the job as an IT consultant for a small company in Denmark, specializing in the modern workplace, primarily using Intune and Autopilot. Of course back then, buzzwords like "modern workplace" didn't exist, so we just called it something else: Device Management! 
I succesfully implemented Autopilot and other technologies using Microsoft Intune in small, medium and large companies.

In March 2021 I decided it was time to try something new, so I started my own company. Within my first few days of being self-employed as a freelancer, I found [APENTO](www.apento.com). A small network for highly specialized freelancers within the Microsoft space, all self-employed myself, highly motivated and super driven to achieve the best results for our customers. In APENTO I continued working within the modern workplace, where I am still working today. I spent most of my time helping a large company in Denmark adopting Intune and Autopilot, whilst I also have smaller customers on the side that I'm assisting occasionally.

Lately I have spent a lot of time testing and working on products in the Intune suite, also with my customers, so do not be surprised if you hear me speaking or blogging about the Intune suite.
