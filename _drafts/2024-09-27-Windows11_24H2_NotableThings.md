I got my hands on a new Dell XPS 13 Qualcomm based device back in late July, and I have been following the buzz around Windows 11 24H2 in the media for the past few months and boy does it seem like it will be a proper feature update this time. Based on what I know and what I've seen published Windows 11 22H2 and 23H2 is going to pale in comparison.

And why did I mention that I got a Dell XPS 13 Qualcomm based device? Well the new Qualcomm based devices comes with some Copilot features, I.e: The copilot button on the keyboard but more important it also includes a new kid on the block: The NPU! So to proper utilize those new features on a new shiny device, the OEMs has been shipping Windows 11 24H2 way ahead of schedule, even before it has been released to the public.

Let's get into the fun stuff already :)

## Built-in 7zip support

It's hard to believe after all of these years that Windows will now feature built-in support for 7zip.. gone are the days where we need to push 7zip to our users.
